# CS251Lab3_Gomoku

This will be public for a while till I create something that I'm more proud of in Java, whether that is for school or not.

Gomoku is like Tic Tac Toe but on a bigger grid. This project was a class assignment for my intermediate programming class in Java. This particular version has a super basic AI that I will one day make better and smarter. You can choose to play with the AI or not. I believe the CMD line instructions on how to play with the AI or not is in the JavaDocs on the .java.
